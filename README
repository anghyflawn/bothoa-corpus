This program is used to parse the text file containing all the forms
found in

Humphreys, Humphrey Lloyd (1995). Phonologie et morphosyntaxe du
parler breton de Bothoa en Saint-Nicolas-du-Pélém,
Côtes-d'Armor. Brest: Emgleo Breiz

The program parses the file and creates a database to represent all
the data it contains, which can be queried along a variety of
dimensions such as stress patterns, segment distributions, possible
and impossible adjacent sequences etc. A number of queries are already
written and can be combined in various ways.
